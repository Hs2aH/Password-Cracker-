# Password-Cracker-
This is a multi-threaded C++ command-line tool designed to demonstrate and test password security by performing brute-force and wordlist attacks on cryptographic hashes. It utilizes the OpenSSL library for hashing functions (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) and supports resuming a brute-force attack from a previously saved state.
